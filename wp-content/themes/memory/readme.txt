In order to make the theme works properly, you need to install the Recommended plugins first. Simply go to the Dashboard -> Appearance -> Memory -> Implement Recommended Actions. Then click on Install the Recommended plugins.

After installing Recommended plugins, which includes Jetpack, you need to connect to WordPress.com to use it (it requires you to create an account on wordpress.com – which is free). If you don’t want to create an account on wordpress.com, you can enable the Jetpack development mode.
